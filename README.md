# RLToolBox
Reinforcement Learning Toolbox

## Goal
The goal of this project was to develop a framework allowing to easily experiment and play with basic reinforcement learning algorithms.
RLToolBox consist of 3 main groups of components:
  * reinforcement learning algorithms
  * basic grid and continuous state environments
  * approximators, that can be used to perform experiments in continuous state environments.
  

# How to use
Unzip this package, and add it to PYTHONPATH environment variable.
Install all requirements with command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then you'll be able to import its modules into your scripts or Jupyter Notebooks.


# Examples of usage in experiments
Folder `scripts` contains various ready to use examples of experiments scenarios.
